            <h3>To minimize risk from Highchairs</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>A chair should be stable and have a wide base to reduce the risk of tipping.</li>
                <li>There should be a restraint system that consists of a 3- or 5- point harness system that should fit snug and keep your child in place.</li>
                <li>If using a booster seat, make sure your child has proper coordination to sit up properly in one and use all straps to secure your child.</li>

            </ul>
