            <h3>To minimize risk of choking</h3>
            
            <ul>
         
                    
                    <li>Whether a blind is up or down, make sure children can’t reach the cords. Install a cleat or tie-down device up high on the wall and use it to keep cords out of reach.</li>
                    <li>Do not put furniture that a child can climb up on and do not place a playpen near a window where a child can reach a cord. This may pose strangulation risks.</li>
                    <li>Make sure that button batteries in household products stay secure in these items.</li>
                    <li>Always supervise children when playing with toys that use button batteries such as musical greeting cards and children’s books.</li>
                    <li>Look around your floors for things that may have dropped such as coins, jewelry or buttons. Children can put these things in their mouths and choke.</li>
                    <li>Be aware of older children who may give a younger child food, toys, etc. that they could potentially choke on.</li>
