            <p>It is important to plan out a trip when travelling with children. See below for some tips on how to make flying a pleasant experience for you and your child.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>If your child has a health condition, check with your doctor before travelling. Babies 7-14 days old should not fly, if they must, talk to your doctor first.</li>
                <li>Airlines have different policies about age and travel, so it’s best to check with them before you make plans.</li>
                <li>Children under 2 years old who do not have their own seat must sit in a parent’s lap during takeoff and landing. You will be shown prior to take-off how to hold your child properly throughout the flight to avoid injury.</li>
                <li>Breastfeeding, sucking from a bottle or pacifier may be of some relief during takeoff and landing.</li>
                <li>Try to avoid sitting in an aisle seat with your child. If they are reaching into the aisle they could get their arm bumped with a serving cart.</li>
                <li>Pack enough food, diapers, bottles, medicine and clothes in your carry-on bag in case of delayed flights or lost luggage.</li>
