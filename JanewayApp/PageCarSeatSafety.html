            <p>Car seats are designed to protect children from injury during a collision. The type of seat your child needs depends on your child’s age and size.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Keep your child in a rear-facing car seat for as long as you can. If your child grows out of the rear-facing car seat, there maybe another model that will fit your child that is rear-facing.</li>
                <li>It is ok if your child’s legs touch the back of your vehicle seat.</li>
                <li>Even if your child fits the regulations for a forward-facing car seat, your child is safer in the rear-facing car seat as long as he/she is still below the car seat’s weight and height limits.</li>
                <li>Many car seats are not installed correctly. If you are no t sure there may be a car seat clinic in your community. Here is a link to find out: <a href="http://www.kidsinsafeseats.ca/">http://www.kidsinsafeseats.ca</a></li>
                <li>The car seat should be attached tightly and not move more than an inch from side-to-side or front-to-back. Make sure to connect and tighten the car seat’s tether to the tether anchor attachment in the car.</li>
                <li>Make sure the harness is snug every time you place your child in a car seat and threaded at or just below your child’s shoulders, the chest clip should be at armpit level. If more than one finger fits between the shoulder harness and your child’s collarbone, the harness is too loose.</li>
                <li>Car seats do expire. Find and check the label, to make sure it is still safe to use if not buying a new car seat.</li>
                <li>Do not attach anything to a car seat that did not come with it, such as mirrors and toys.</li>
                <li>Replace car seats that have cracks, straps that are worn out or if they have been involved in a car accident.</li>
                <li>Do not leave for child in a car seat to sleep.</li>
