            <h3>To minimize risk of Crib safety</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Do not use a crib made before 1986, as it does not meet current regulations.</li>
                <li>Always follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions for putting together and using the crib.</li>
                <li>Avoid the use of loose bedding and soft objects such as blankets, quilts, soft toys and pillows</li>
                <li>Place the mattress in the lowest position once your child can push up on his/her hands and knees and remove mobiles as well at this time.</li>
                <li>Never place a crib near a window. If you do make sure drapery and blind cords are out of reach to prevent strangulation.</li>
                
                    
                    
                    </ul>
