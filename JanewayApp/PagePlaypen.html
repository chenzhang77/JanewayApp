            <h3>To minimize risk of playpen</h3>
            
            <ul>
                
                
                <li>Never tie a pacifier or other items around a childâ€™s neck or affix a cord to clothing. Children have fallen in playpens and caused serious injury because a cord or string was caught on the playpen.</li>
                <li>Playpens are not intended to be used for unsupervised sleep; they do not meet the same safety regulations as cribs.</li>
                <li>Do not add blankets, pillows, an extra mattress or stuffed toys to playpens.</li>
                <li>Supervise a child in a playpen at all times.</li>
                <li>Do not place a playpen near doors or other furniture.</li>
                <li>Do not place large stuffed animals in the playpen, your child could use them to climb out.</li>

                
                
                
                
            </ul>
