            <h3>To minimize risk of Falls</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>It’s advisable to mount your TV if you have a flat screen, to the wall. If this is not possible, make sure that brackets and straps are used to keep it in place on a stand.</li>
                <li>Make sure the TV is as far back on the stand as possible so that children cannot touch it.</li>
                <li>Don’t have loose rugs on the floor which are easy for children to trip on.
                <li>Make sure all furniture that children can climb onto such as book shelves and TV stands; are sturdy and won’t fall over onto your child. “L” brackets can be used to attach furniture to walls.</li>
                <li>Add protective padding around corners of coffee tables or any piece of furniture with sharp edges.</li>
                <li>Install window guards or make sure that they won’t open more than 4 inches. Window screens don’t prevent falls.</li>
                <li>Use socks with treads while in the house to help prevent slips and falls.</li>
                <li>Choose lamps that have a sturdy base and cannot be knocked over easily.</li>

                
                
                
                
            </ul>
            
            
        </body>
