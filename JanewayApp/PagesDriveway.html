                <li>When possible back into your driveway so that you can pull forward. If you must back out of your driveway, check all mirrors carefully or do a walk around your car before to make sure there are no children around.</li>
                <li>Make sure walkways and stairwell are well lit and free of toys or objects blocking a clear path.</li>
                <li>Keep all outdoor toys in a dry and secure place when not in use.</li>
                <li>Inspect front and backyards regularly for glass, metal and sharp objects.</li>
                <li>Empty water containers such as large pails and wading pools. Children can drown in as little as an inch of water.</li>
