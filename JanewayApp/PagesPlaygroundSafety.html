            <p>Here are some useful tips to make your trips to the playground with your child fun and injury free.
</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>When choosing a playground make sure the structures are rights for your child’s age and stage of development.</li>
                <li>Make sure there is no garbage or glass on or around the equipment.</li>
                <li>Stay close to your child.</li>
                <li>Make sure there are no drawstrings or other cords on your child’s clothing, which can get trapped in equipment.</li>
                <li>Have your child slide down feet first, only. Be mindful of rubber soles. Don't climb up the slide to get a stuck child or let your child climb up the slide.</li>
                <li>Watch out for wet equipment. Check equipment's temperature on a hot day to avoid burns, especially on the slide. Check the playground for broken equipment and make sure your child stays away from it.</li>
                <li>Make sure your child is sitting while they swing. Be careful they don't walk near someone swinging; they could get kicked or hit. Slow down before getting off swings.</li>
