            <p>Stroller safety begins with choosing the proper stroller to fit you and your child’s lifestyle and needs.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Always supervise your child when he/she is in a stroller.</li>
                <li>Make sure your child is seated properly and that the safety harness and lap belts are fastened correctly.</li>
                <li>Use the brakes when taking your child out or putting them in the stroller.</li>
                <li>Get a stroller that is made for your child’s age, height and weight. Newborns need to be able to lie almost flat in strollers as they cannot hold their heads up.</li>
                <li>Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for putting additional items or accessories on or in the stroller.</li>
                <li>Never place purses on the handles of a stroller, the weight of the purse could tip the stroller backwards.</li>
                <li>Fold and unfold the stroller away from children to avoid pinching fingers.</li>
