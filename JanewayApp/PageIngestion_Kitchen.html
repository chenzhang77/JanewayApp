                <li>Laundry packets are extremely toxic and should be used with caution around children. Keep them in a locked cupboard and try to do laundry when your children are not around you.</li>

                <li>Keep products in their original containers so everyone knows what they are.</li>
                <li>When poisonous products cannot be locked keep them up high out of reach of children.</li>
                <li>Install safety latches, locks and doorknob covers on all cupboards, closets and doors when poisonous products are kept.</li>
